About: 
Speechy, is an AI-powered pronunciation practice tool designed for kids to improve their English speaking skills. Based on the selected age group (6-8, 9-11, 12-13), the app provides a set of sentences for children to repeat. The app uses Whisper, an open-source speech recognition model, to transcribe the child's speech and compare it with the expected sentence. It then provides feedback on the accuracy of their pronunciation, helping them track their improvement. The difficulty of sentences increases with age to offer age-appropriate challenges.
